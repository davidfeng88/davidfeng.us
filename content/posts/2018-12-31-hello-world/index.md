Happy New Year!

My current personal portfolio site hasn't seen major changes since its inception about 1.5 years ago. I've been working as a software developer for a year and I think the site deserves a major upgrade.

<!--truncate-->

I learned about [static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/) a couple of days ago, and it seems like exactly what I need. Since I am learning golang, I decided to give Hugo a try. After going through [Mike Dane's Hugo tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtIqKaDlqXo&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3) (highly recommended. It seems that you don't really need to know a lot of golang to use Hugo) and some setup, my new personal website is live at [https://beta.davidfeng.us/](https://beta.davidfeng.us/) now! I plan to move it to [https://davidfeng.us/](https://davidfeng.us/) once I think it's in a better shape.

The new site is definitely a lot better than previous versions. Some of the features that I like the most includes:

- I can have a blog with unlimited pages without having to manage all the HTML files myself
- It is easy to organize multiple pages via the taxonomy mechanisms provided in Hugo (categories and tags)
- I like the Hermit theme a lot!

I am pretty sure I'll discover more good stuff as I spend more time with Hugo.

## Previous versions

It is always interesting to look back in time to see old versions of my personal site/page. It seems I consistently updated the design of the site every two years since 2013.

### 2013

I am pretty sure this is not my first attempt to build a personal website, but it's the oldest one that I can find. I was a chemistry graduate student at the University of Chicago, and I did not really know a lot about HTML/CSS. I wrote all HTML and CSS by hand. The site contains no JavaScript (except Google Analytics). I even put some strange badges on the site because I was so proud that the site passed some w3c XHTML and CSS tests that I can't remember now.

### 2015

The content did not really change. The biggest change is the usage of Bootstrap, which looks much better than my hand written CSS. It is also mobile friendly.

### 2017

I built this site during the job search curriculum at AppAcademy. The content is brand new since I'm trying to get hired as a software developer, not as a research chemist. It contains only one page. I used [the prologue template from HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/prologue), and I edited the HTML and CSS files directly.
