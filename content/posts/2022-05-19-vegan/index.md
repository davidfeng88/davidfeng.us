Today I decided to figure out what are the differences between vegan and vegetarian diets. [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=vegan+vs+vegetarian) pointed me to [this page](https://www.heartfoundation.org.nz/wellbeing/healthy-eating/nutrition-facts/plant-based-vegetarian-vegan-diets) which contains the following table:

While the information is very detailed and helpful, IMHO the table could use some better design. So here is my revised version:

| name                               | eggs | dairy | fish/seafood | meat  | poultry |
| ---------------------------------- | ---- | ----- | ------------ | ----- | ------- |
| Semi-vegetarian or flexitarian     | Y    | Y     | maybe        | maybe | maybe   |
| Pescatarian                        | Y    | Y     | Y            | N     | N       |
| Vegetarian or lacto-ovo vegetarian | Y    | Y     | N            | N     | N       |
| Ovo-vegetarian                     | Y    | N     | N            | N     | N       |
| Lacto-vegetarian                   | N    | Y     | N            | N     | N       |
| Vegan                              | N    | N     | N            | N     | N       |
